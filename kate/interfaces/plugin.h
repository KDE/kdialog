   * \section plugin_intro Introduction
   *
   * The Plugin class is the central part of a Kate plugin. It is possible to
   * represent your plugin in the GUI with a subclass of PluginView. Furthermore
   * if the plugin is configurable (and thus has config pages) you have to
   * additionally derive your plugin from PluginConfigPageInterface.
   *
   * \section plugin_config Configuration Management
   *
   * When Kate loads a session it calls readSessionConfig(), so if you have
   * config settings use this function to load them. To save config settings
   * for a session use writeSessionConfig(), as it will be called whenever a
   * session is saved/closed.
   *
   * If you want to save config settings which are not bound to a session but
   * valid for all plugin instances you have to create your own KConfig like
   * this:
   * \code
   * KConfig* myConfig = new KConfig("katemypluginrc");
   * \endcode
   *
   * \section plugin_views Plugin Views
   *
   * If your plugin needs to be present in the GUI (e.g. menu or toolbar
   * entries) you have to subclass PluginView and return a new instance of your
   * plugin view, like this:
   * \code
   * class MyPluginView : public Kate::PluginView
   * {
   *     Q_OBJECT
   * public:
   *     MyPluginView(MainWindow *mainWindow);
   *
   *     // possibilities of gui:
   *     // - hook into the menus with KXMLGUIClient
   *     // - create a toolView and put a widget into it with MainWindow::createToolView()
   * };
   *
   * class MyPlugin : public Kate::Plugin
   * {
   *     Q_OBJECT
   *
   * public:
   *     // other methods etc...
   *     PluginView *createView(MainWindow *mainWindow)
   *     {
   *         return new MyPluginView(mainWindow);
   *     }
   * };
   * \endcode
   * The Kate application takes care and deletes all plugin views. Further
   * information can be found in the class documentation of PluginView.
   *
   * \section plugin_configpages Config Pages
   *
   * If your plugin is configurable it makes sense to have config pages which
   * appear in Kate's settings dialog. To tell the plugin loader that your
   * plugin supports config pages you have to additionally derive your plugin
   * from the class PluginConfigPageInterface. Read the class documentation for
   * PluginConfigPageInterface to see how to do this right.

   *
   * \section intro Introduction
   *
   * The class PluginView is a interface for the view of a plugin.
   *
   * \section views Plugin Views
   *
   * The Kate application supports multiple mainwindows (Window > New Window).
   * For every Kate MainWindow Plugin::createView() is called, i.e. overwrite
   * createView() in your Plugin derived class and hook your view into the given
   * mainwindow's KXMLGUIFactory. That means
   * you have to create an own KXMLGUIClient derived \e PluginView class and
   * create an own instance for \e every mainwindow. One PluginView then is
   * bound to this specific MainWindow.
   *
   * As already mentioned in the Plugin class documentation, readSessionConfig()
   * and writeSessionConfig() are called to load and save session related data.
   *
   * \section example Basic PluginView Example
   *
   * A PluginView is bound to a single MainWindow. To add GUI elements KDE's
   * GUI XML frameworks is used, i.e. the MainWindow provides a KXMLGUIFactory
   * into which the KXMLGUIClient is to be hooked. So the plugin view must
   * inherit from KXMLGUIClient, the following example shows the basic skeleton
   * of the PluginView.
   * \code
   *   class PluginView : public QObject, public KXMLGUIClient
   *   {
   *       Q_OBJECT
   *   public:
   *       // Constructor and other methods
   *       PluginView( Kate::MainWindow* mainwindow )
   *         : QObject( mainwindow ), KXMLGUIClient( mainwindow ),
   *           m_mainwindow(mainwindow)
   *       { ... }
   *       // ...
   *   private:
   *       Kate::MainWindow* m_mainwindow;
   *   };
   * \endcode
   * To embedd a plugin view as a tool view you have to call
   * MainWindow::createToolView() and hook your gui into the returned widget.
   *
   * \see Plugin, KXMLGUIClient, MainWindow
