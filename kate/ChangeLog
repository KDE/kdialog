  * kate switched over to katemdi, even smaller replacement for kmdi2 :)

2004-10-06 Christoph Cullmann <cullmann@kde.org>
  * kate switched over to kmdi2, a slim version of old kmdi
    which allows only IDEA mode, but should be much less buggy
    beside this, we now allow tabbing thx to the new kmdi stuff
    and therefor should now be really feature complete at least mdi
    wise, having the features to allow multiple main windows,
    tabbing, splitters, widget stacks for the views, now only missing thingy
    would be to allow non kate view's to be embeded, like a khtml widget for
    documentation browsing or something like that

2003-08-28 Christoph Cullmann <cullmann@kde.org>
  * jowenn switch kate over to use kmdi, seems to work well
    for the first port, but still needs some fixes ;)

2002-07-19 Christoph Cullmann <cullmann@kde.org>
  * new interface structure implemented
    this is BIC and source incompatible to 2.x and 3.0.x plugins

2002-01-04 Christoph Cullmann <cullmann@kde.org>
  * the search stuff in the katedocument is rewritten now, should work mostly,
    only search for whole words is just a mess :(

2002-01-03 Christoph Cullmann <cullmann@kde.org>
  * kate app and kwrite app now use the katepart via libloader and link only
    to the kateinterfaces (which will soon be splitted into katepartinterfaces
    and kateinterfaces
  * new framework for the configpages of the katepart accessible through the
    interfaces
  * KSpell works again ;) my god, what a buggy thingy

2001-12-01 Christoph Cullmann <cullmann@kde.org>
  * speedup for insert/removeText/Line
  * new editStart/editEnd/editAddUndo functions to make the undo/redo + update
     after edit function calls easier to understand an use in katedocument.*

2001-11-30 Joseph Wenninger <jowenn@kde.org>
  * I hopefully fixed the CSS highlighting finally. It used
     deprecated syntax and there was a bug in the highlighting code,
     for handling weakDeliminiators. Who renamed them, once they where
     called weakDelimiters, which I think is the correct pronounciation.

2001-11-29 Joseph Wenninger <jowenn@kde.org>
  * KWrite/Kate use different font settings for printing and viewing now
  * Fixed a small crash in my kdevelop->kate port of the codecompletion interface

    of storing the selection in the attributes

2001-10-29 Joseph Wenninger <jowenn@kde.org>

  * fix ctx managment (almost)

2001-10-27 Joseph Wenninger <jowenn@kde.org
  * Highlighting isn't updated completely yet (should be fixed now), but uses:
  * I have to do some nasty workaround because the overloaded ==
    operator in QMemArray crashes, if one or both of the arrays has
    a size of 0 (I think this is a bug in QT, but it could be that
    this is intended behaviour. Who knows ?)

2001-10-26 Joseph Wenninger <jowenn@kde.org>
  * The stacked highlighting shoul almost work now.
    Using old description files it will use quite a lot memory, but
    they should work.
    Problems:
  * It's leaking like a sieve on destruction, because the
    memarrays aren't deleted correctly yet (They need to be pointers and not
    references, otherwise there are out of memory errors in qgarray)
  * Highlighting isn't updated completely yet
  * I have to do some nasty workaround because the overloaded ==
    operator in QMemArray crashes, if one or both of the arrays has
    a size of 0 (I think this is a bug in QT, but it could be that
    this is intended behaviour. Who knows ?)

2001-10-20 Christoph Cullmann <cullmann@kde.org>

  * HTML button - select text, hit <Ctrl+Dash>, and enter the fields
    for an SGML tag. Don't enter the < > or closing tag. We put these
    around the selected text, and [try to] re-select that text so you can add
    another nested tag right away. We are now the first HTML editor
    that's actually better than Notepad! Hours of fun.

  * Filter - select text, hit <Ctrl+Backslash>, and enter an OS command.
    we pipe the selected text thru that command, such as "sort", and then
    replace the selection with the result. Impress your friends.
