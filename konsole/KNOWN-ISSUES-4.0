Known issues in KDE 4.0.0

- The Konsole handbook has not been updated to match the new user interface 
  in KDE 4.0.0

- The --enable-transparency commandline argument must be passed to the first
  instance of Konsole started to enable transparency on desktops which support
  it (eg. those using Compiz Fusion or KWin 4 with Desktop Effects)

  This is due to problems with windows using ARGB visuals 
  (ie. windows which support transparency) on composited desktops with certain graphics
  cards (eg. NVidia) at the time of the release.  

- Transparency does not work in embedded terminals when the host application
  supports it.

- When starting a new Konsole instance from within an existing Konsole window
  (eg. by typing 'konsole' at a shell prompt and pressing enter) any output
  (eg. help information, debugging output) is sent to the terminal from which
  the original Konsole instance was started, not the terminal from which the 
  new Konsole instance was started.

- There is no session management support.  Konsole does not remember open tabs 
  or more than one open window between logging off and then back in again.

- There is no 'Send Input To All' feature

- There is no support for terminal programs resizing the Konsole window, although
  they may change the screen size.  If the new screen size does not fit within the
  existing window then the user must manually make the Konsole window larger.

- 'Detach View' is irreversible since tabs cannot be dragged between windows

- 'Open Folder in Tabs' does not create terminal sessions for SSH bookmarks.

- 'Open Folder in Tabs' will not create terminal sessions in the bookmarked
  directories if the default profile specifies a home folder.  Instead the 
  default profile's home folder will be used for all sessions.

- Rename tab only changes the local tab title format.  This means that the changes
  will not have an effect whilst running an ssh session inside a terminal.

- Automatic tab titles are not updated when a new terminal session is started, the
  update occurs after the first user input.
