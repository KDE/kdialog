New features in Konsole in KDE 4.0:

- New terminal setup.  The terminal setup dialogs from KDE 3
  have been replaced with a new set which are much easier to use.
  Settings are saved in groups as 'profiles', which can be used
  as the basis for a new tab or applied to an existing tab.

- The new terminal setup dialogs are shared with the embedded 
  terminal for better consistency.  The users' profiles, including
  their default terminal settings are shared between the Konsole application 
  and the embedded terminal.

- Cleaner user interface.  The menus have been reorganised to make
  them less cluttered.  Many keyboard shortcuts have been added to 
  reduce the need to go to the menu for common tasks.

- Split view.  A Konsole window can be divided horizontally or
  vertically into multiple areas.  Each area contains a tab bar
  with one tab for each terminal session running in that window.
  This makes it possible to display two or more views on different
  parts of the same session.  For example, it is possible to scan
  past output in one view whilst entering new commands to the same
  terminal session in another view.

- Automatic tab titles.  Tab titles are automatically set to
  make terminal sessions within a window easily identifiable.  
  Tab titles by default include a shortened version of the 
  terminal's current directory and the last program run.
  Separate tab title formats can be defined for local and 
  remote (eg. ssh sessions) activities.

- Incremental search.  A new incremental search bar has been added
  for easier searching of terminal output.  Matches are highlighted
  automatically in the output window.  Performance when searching
  through large volumes of output has been improved.

- Key bindings editor.  Key bindings specify how sequences of key
  presses in the terminal window map to the characters actually
  sent to the terminal.  The profile editor features a new dialog
  for editing key bindings from within Konsole. 

- Better performance.  Scrolling large terminal displays is now much
  quicker.  Handling of large volumes of output to the terminal is 
  now much quicker.  Better resource sharing between Konsole 
  instances.

- Link and email address highlighting.  Email addresses and links in output
  text are now identified automatically and can be opened by right clicking
  on the link or email address and selecting the 'Open' action.

- 'Open Browser Here'.  Opens Dolphin (or the users preferred file browser)
  at the terminal program's current directory.

- 'Bookmark Tabs as Folder'.  Bookmarks the current group of tabs in a
  new bookmark folder.

- Easier bookmarking of SSH sessions.  Clicking 'Add Bookmark' creates a new
  bookmark to a user and host which starts an SSH session when selected.

- Cursor shape choice.  The cursor style can be chosen from three options:
  Block (default), I-Beam or Underline

- Cusor color choice.  The cursor color can now be specified or set to match
  the current character (default)

- Transparent terminal windows.  Color schemes have adjustable transparency 
  which will be used when running Konsole on a desktop which supports it.

  (Important Note:  The --enable-transparency commandline argument must be 
   passed to the first Konsole instance started to enable transparency.
   This is a temporary requirement.)
