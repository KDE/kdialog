<sect>Introduction

<p>
<bf/Kfind/ looks for files matching search criteria within a directory hierarchy.
<p>
Often you know that a file is 'out there somewhere', but you can't remember where it is, even with a good effort.
So <bf/KFind/ is exactly the tool for that problem. Having found 
the required file(s), you can:
<itemize>
<item>save them,
<item>delete them,
<item>change their file properties,
<item>store them to archives and/or
<item>open the directory containing the file(s) in the file manager (<bf/Kfm/).
</itemize>

<p>
I hope you find this program useful and I would appreciate any suggestions and comments.

<sect>Installation
<p>

<sect1>How to Obtain KFind
<p>
KFind is a part of the KDE project <url url="http://www.kde.org">. KFind can be found on
<url url="ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/">, the main ftp site of the KDE project.
There are links to many FTP mirrors there as well.

<sect1>Requirements
<p>
In order to successfully compile KFind, you need the latest versions
of <tt>libkdecore</tt> and <tt>libkfm</tt>. All required libraries
as well as KFind itself can be found on <url url="ftp://ftp.kde.org/pub/kde/">.

<sect1>Compilation and installation
<p>
<bf/Kfind/ is normally an integrated part of a KDE release and therefore
will be automatically installed with other KDE applications in the normal
course of KDE installation.

If you need to compile and install KFind yourself on your system, type the
following in the base directory of the KFind distribution:
<tscreen>
<verb> 
% ./configure 
% make 
% make install 
</verb>
</tscreen>

Since KFind uses <tt/autoconf/, you should not have trouble compiling it.
Should you run into problems, please report them to the <bf/KDE/ mailing lists.

<sect1>Configuration
<p>
Configuration is normally performed by means of the Preferences dialog;
see the user section of this manual for more details. A technical description
of <bf/kfind/ configuration follows for interested parties:

<p>
<bf/Kfind/ reads configuration parameters from a configuration
file (normally <tt>~/.kde/share/config/kfindrc</tt>).

This file contains information about saving search results, available
archivers and other configuration parameters; these parameters can be edited
from the <tt/Kfind/ <bf/Preferences/ dialog. 

<p>
<bf/General information:/ the resource file consists of sections.
Each section is started by a header title in square braces e.g.<tt/[Saving]/

<p>
Information following the header relates to a specific aspect of
<tt/Kfind/ operation.

<p>
<bf/Saving configuration:/ The configuration file holds the filename
and format of the file to be used for saving search results. These parameters
are stored as follows:
<tscreen>
<verb>
[Saving]
Format=HTML
Filename=/root/result.html
</verb>
</tscreen>
Where <tt/Format/ entry can have values <tt/HTML /or <tt/Plain Text/.

<p><bf/Archiver configuration:/ Archivers available for <tt/kfind/ are
specified in <it>kfindrc</it> entry <tt/[Archiver Types]/ as follows:
<tscreen>
<verb>
[Archiver Types]
Archivers=tar;zip;zoo;
</verb>
</tscreen>

And each archiver is detaily described by its own entry:
<tscreen>
<verb>
[tar]
ExecOnCreate=tar cf %a -C %d %n
ExecOnUpdate=tar uf %a -C %d %n
Comment=Tar
</verb>
</tscreen>

The first line contains the command to be executed when creating a new
archive and the second is for updating existing archives. The third one
is the comment used for archiver description in <bf/Preferences/ dialog.
Variables may be used in these commands, and are denoted by a leading %
sign.
<p>
The following is a list of legal command line variables:

<p><tt/%a/ The complete name of the archive

<p><tt/%f/ The normal file name

<p><tt/%d/ The parent directory. If the given argument is a file
( not a directory ) then this will give you the directory this file is in.

<p><tt/%n/ The name of the file. If the given argument is a directory
then this is the name of this directory.
<p>

<sect>Onscreen Fundamentals
<p>
In this section will be briefly described Kfind user interface. 
<p>
The <bf/Kfind/ window is separated into three areas: toolbar, search parameters
dialog, and viewing area. The viewing area and statusbar are visible only
after receiving search results.
<p>

<sect1>Toolbar

	dialog.	
	<tag/New Search/
	Clears results and starts with new parameters.
	<tag/Stop Search/
	Stops running search process.
	<tag/Open/
	Asks <bf/Kfm/ to start default binding for selected file.
	<tag/Add to Archive/

	<tag/Properties/

	<tag/Quit/

</descrip>

<sect1>Search Parameters Dialog
<p>
This dialog is the main part of <tt/KFind/. It's used for specifying
parameter for find utility. There are three find parameters groups:

<descrip>
	<tag/Name and location/
	This dialog is used to specify a filename to look
for. This Filename is entered into combobox and can contain following
wildcards:
<tscreen>
      ? matches any character 
<p>
      * matches any sequence of characters 
<p>
      [ ] matches a defines set of characters, e.g. [a-zA-Z0-9]
matches upper and lower case ASCII letters and digits.
<p>
      \  sign is alphanumerical or a point
</tscreen>
The combo box stores names history.  The <bf/Browse/ button is used to specify directory
where the search will be performed. Whether the find should look into subdirectories
is specified by <bf/Include subfolders/ check button.
	<tag/Date Modified/
	This dialog allows searching for files created or modified within a
specified time period.
	<tag/Advanced/
	This dialog allows file searches for specific types of files e.g
Postscript-documents, JPEG image files or WAV sound files.

</descrip>

<sect1>Viewing Area
<p>
The viewing area contains results of find process. After a file has been 
selected, the functions open, add to archive,delete, properties and open 
containing folder are enabled.  Double clicking causes execution.

<sect>The Menu Entries
<p>

<sect1>File
<p>
The following functions are available from the file menu:
<descrip>
	<tag/Open/ 
	This option calls <bf/kfm/ to open the currently selected file,
using the default binding e.g Program files will be executed, text
files will start the text editor, etc. This action can also be
performed by double-clicking on the filename in the list.
	<tag/Add to archive/ 
	Adds the selected file to an archive.
	<tag/Delete/
	Deletes the selected file.
	<tag/Properties/
	Allows the properties of the selected file to be altered.
	<tag/Open Containing Folder/
	Opens the directory containing the selected file in a file
manager (KFM) window
	<tag/Save Search/
	Saves the list of selected files
	<tag/Quit/
	Exit <tt>Kfind</tt>
</descrip>

<sect1>Edit
<p>
Entries in this menu are disabled.

<sect1>Options 
<p>

From this menu you can start the preferences dialog.  The first tab
of the preferences dialog allows one to select the name and format of
the file where search results are stored. The second tab shows available 
filetypes and archivers details.

<descrip>
	<tag/Saving/
	Specify the file name where the the search results are stored. 
The default is <tt/.kfind-results.html/ in the user's home directory.
If another name is chosen, one can specify the format of the stored results.
HTML and Text (.txt) are the currently supported formats. 
	<tag/Archivers/
	This dialog allows viewing (and in the future, probably editing)
of the archiver definitions used by <it/Add to Archive/ function.
</descrip>
