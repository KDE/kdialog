<title>&konqueror; the File Manager</title>

<sect1 id="dirfolders">
<title>Folders and Paths</title>
<para>In &UNIX; and &Linux; all folders are arranged in a simple 
hierarchy. Starting from a top level folder (also called the root directory), 
the structure descends and branches containing various files and subfolders. 
This means that you can get from any folder to any other by going <quote>up
</quote> until you reach a common point then <quote>down</quote> through 
the appropriate subfolders until you reach your target.</para>

<para>The position of any file or folder in the structure (also called a 
directory tree) can be described by its <quote>path</quote>, which is a simple 
list of the folders you would have to descend through to get to the target 
folder or file. For example <filename class="directory">/home/pam</filename> 
is the subfolder <filename class="directory">pam</filename> of the subfolder 
<filename class="directory">home</filename> of the top level folder, and 
<filename>/home/pam/words.txt</filename> is the file <filename>words.txt
</filename> in that subfolder. The leading <quote>/</quote> in these paths 
represents the top level folder.</para>

<para>Every folder accessible by your system &mdash; including those on
other hard disk partitions, your floppy and &CD-ROM; &mdash; will appear
in the tree descending from /, their exact paths will depend on how your system
was set up (see also the section on <link linkend="floppy-cd">Floppy and
&CD-ROM; Drives</link>).
</para>
<para>Every user on a &UNIX; / &Linux; system has their own <quote>home</quote> 
folder to hold their personal files and settings; for example
<filename class="directory">/home/john</filename> and  
<filename class="directory">/home/mary</filename>. The 
symbol <keycap>~</keycap> is often used to represent the user's home 
folder, so that <filename>~/letter.txt</filename> refers to the file 
<filename>letter.txt</filename> in my home folder.</para>
<para>Note that the term <quote>directory</quote> is often used instead of 
<quote>folder</quote>.</para>

<sect1 id="viewmode">
<title>View Modes</title>
<para>In File Manager mode, &konqueror; lists which files and subfolders are
contained within a given folder and can provide you with some information about
them. The <quote>path</quote> of the current folder is shown in the Location
Toolbar. The way that &konqueror; displays the files and folders depends mainly
on your choice of view mode which can be selected from the
<menuchoice><guimenu>View</guimenu><guisubmenu>View
Mode</guisubmenu></menuchoice > sub menu. The view modes &konqueror; provides
are outlined below.

In the <guibutton>Icons</guibutton> view, which is the default, files will be

as a detailed list which contains the name, size and last modification time of
each item. Additional columns can be added by clicking a column header with the
&RMB;.

<para>Generally this means that the file's icon will be replaced by a small 
image showing the file contents.</para>
<para>Because &konqueror; has to read much more data than just the file name 
to generate a preview, file previews may not be appropriate when viewing 
files from a remote system. To disable previews for remote files where reading 
the extra data would take too long set a file size limit at the bottom of the

<sect1 id="navigation">
<title>Navigation</title>
<para>To get to a file with &konqueror; you first need to navigate 
through the folder tree to find the folder containing that 
file.</para>

<para>To move between folders you can simply step up and down the
tree:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>To descend into a subfolder <mousebutton>left
</mousebutton> click on its name or
icon -- or if you have already <quote>selected</quote> it (see below) -- then just press
&Enter;.</para></listitem> 
<listitem><para>To go up the folder tree you can click on the <guiicon>Up
</guiicon> button in the Toolbar, use<keycombo action="simul">&Alt;<keysym>Up</keysym></keycombo>, or use the Menubar
<menuchoice><guimenu>Go</guimenu><guimenuitem>Up</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
option.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>To <quote>select</quote> a file or folder in the displayed folder 
without opening it in any way use the <keysym>up</keysym> and <keysym>down
</keysym> arrow keys to move through the items. 
The selected item will be highlighted and some information about it 
will be displayed in the Status Bar.</para>

<para>Setting the <link linkend="viewmode">View Mode</link> to <guimenuitem>
Details</guimenuitem> with the option <guilabel>Expandable Folders</guilabel> 
can help you locate folders in the tree below the 
current folder; in this mode each folder is shown with a small box at 
the left. If the box contains a <keycap>+</keycap> sign, <mousebutton>left
</mousebutton> clicking on the box (not on the folder name or icon) will 
display a sub tree showing files and subfolders contained in that folder. 
The small box will then change to show a <keycap>-</keycap> sign. 
<mousebutton>Left</mousebutton> click on that to collapse the sub tree. Once 
you have found the folder you are looking for, <mousebutton>left
</mousebutton> click on the folder name or icon to open it.</para>

<para>The <link linkend="sidebar">Sidebar</link> can also help you 
find your way around the file system.</para>

<para>You can go directly to any folder by typing its path into the
Location Toolbar window or into the dialog box invoked by the Menubar
<menuchoice><guimenu>File</guimenu><guimenuitem>Open Location</guimenuitem>
</menuchoice> item or by <keycombo action="simul">&Alt;<keycap>
O</keycap></keycombo>. &konqueror;'s <link linkend="path-complete">
Text Completion</link> feature may be useful when you do this. Don't forget
that in &Linux; / &UNIX; file and folder names are case sensitive.</para>

<para>When you have moved to a new folder you can go back to your
previous choice by using the Toolbar <guiicon>Back</guiicon> button, the
Menubar
<menuchoice><guimenu>Go</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Back</guimenuitem></menuchoice>
item, or <keycombo action="simul">&Alt;<keysym>Left</keysym></keycombo>. 
Once you have gone back you can go forward. Use the Toolbar
<guiicon>Forward</guiicon> button, the Menubar
<menuchoice><guimenu>Go</guimenu>
<guimenuitem>Forward</guimenuitem></menuchoice> item or <keycombo
action="simul">&Alt;<keysym>Right</keysym></keycombo>.</para>

<para>Alternatively, you can also choose to enter the parent folder by clicking on the Toolbar <guiicon>Up</guiicon>, the <menuchoice><guimenu>Go</guimenu> <guimenuitem>Up</guimenuitem></menuchoice> item, or with <keycombo
action="simul">&Alt;<keysym>Up</keysym></keycombo>.</para>

<tip><para>Click the checkmark at the right of the toolbar <guiicon>Up</guiicon>, 
<guiicon>Back</guiicon> or <guiicon>Forward</guiicon> buttons or selecting these 
items in the <guimenu>Go</guimenu> menu brings up a submenu of recently visited locations.</para>

<sect2 id="file-find">
<title>Finding Files and Folders</title>

<para>If you don't know or can't remember where a file or folder is within
your system, then use the Toolbar <guiicon>Find File</guiicon> button or the
Menubar <menuchoice><guimenu>Tools</guimenu><guimenuitem>Find 
File...</guimenuitem></menuchoice> option.  This will embed the file finder 
application &kfind; into &konqueror;'s window. See the &kfind; Handbook 
for help in using &kfind;.
</para>

<note><para>If the name of a file or folder begins with a period (dot), then
it is a <quote>hidden</quote> file or folder, and will not normally be shown
by &konqueror;. To see hidden files or folders use the Menubar <menuchoice>
<guimenu>View</guimenu><guimenuitem>Show Hidden Files</guimenuitem>
</menuchoice> option.</para>
<para>Another reason &konqueror; may not show the file or folder you are 
looking for is that you may have the <link linkend="konq-plugin"><guisubmenu>
View Filter</guisubmenu></link> plugin set to display only certain types of 
file.</para></note>

<title>Floppy and &CD-ROM; Drives</title>

<para>Any floppy disk, &CD; drive or other hard disk partition that you have 
on your system will usually appear in the <filename class="directory">/
</filename>,  <filename class="directory">/media</filename>, <filename class="directory">/mnt</filename> or

like <filename class="directory">/mnt/floppy</filename> or
<filename class="directory">/cdrom</filename>. The details will depend on
how your system was set up.</para>

<para>&UNIX; / &Linux; requires that you <command>mount</command> a floppy disk 
or &CD-ROM; when you have inserted it into the drive, and <command>mount
</command> other hard disk partitions when you want to access them. You also 
need to unmount a floppy disk or &CD-ROM; before removing it to register that 
it is no longer available. </para>

<para>How you do this will depend on how your system:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>You may have an <application>Automount</application> facility,
in which case you don't have to bother about explicitly mounting and
unmounting,
although you may find that the &CD-ROM; occasionally starts up by itself for no
apparent reason.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>You may have <guiicon>Floppy</guiicon>, &CD-ROM; and hard disk 
icons on your desktop, in which case &LMB; click on the icon to mount it. 
Doing this should also bring up a &konqueror; window showing the contents of 
the floppy, &CD-ROM; or partition. To unmount, <mousebutton>right</mousebutton> 
click on the icon and choose the <guimenuitem>Unmount</guimenuitem> item.  
Visit the section <link linkend="making">Create New...</link> in this Handbook 
to see how to create such an icon.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Or you can do it the traditional way by typing into a text
console window:</para>

<para><userinput><command>mount /mnt/floppy</command></userinput></para>

<!-- This markup doesn't work properly, it puts 'mount' and '/mnt/floppy' 
on separate lines

<para><userinput><command>umount /mnt/floppy</command></userinput></para>

<para>to unmount it (<command>umount</command> not <command>unmount</command>).
</para>

<note><para>Rather than having to open a text console to type the

<title>Deleting Files and Folders</title>

<para>&konqueror; gives you two ways to dispose of an unwanted file or

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>You can move it to the <filename>Trash</filename> folder, which
is the safest method as you can get it back if you realize that you have made a
mistake.</para></listitem> 

<listitem><para>You can just plain Delete it, which
removes the entry from the folder and adds the disk area occupied by the

<title>Selecting Items Using the Menu</title>

<para>You sometimes want to delete, copy or move a number of files that are 
similar in some way. For example you may wish to move all of the .png graphics 
files from one folder to another. &konqueror; makes this easy by letting you 
select multiple files based on similarities in their file names.</para>

<para>Use the Menubar
<menuchoice><guimenu>Edit</guimenu><guisubmenu>Selection</guisubmenu>
<guimenuitem>Select Matching Items...</guimenuitem></menuchoice> option or the shortcut
<keycombo action="simul">&Ctrl;<keycap>S</keycap></keycombo>. This
brings up a little dialog box in which you enter a filename containing
the wildcard characters <keycap>*</keycap>, which matches any number
of characters, and <keycap>?</keycap> which matches a single
character. Press <guibutton>OK</guibutton> and &konqueror; will
highlight all files with matching names. For example:</para>
      
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para> <userinput><filename>flag*.png</filename></userinput> will
select all filenames starting with the letters <quote>flag</quote> and ending
with <quote><literal role="extension">.png</literal></quote>.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><userinput><filename>memo?.txt</filename></userinput> will
select <filename>memo1.txt</filename> and <filename>memo9.txt</filename> but
not <filename>memo99.txt</filename>.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>When you have selected a range of files, you can narrow down the
selection
by using the Menubar <menuchoice><guimenu>Edit</guimenu><guisubmenu>Selection</guisubmenu>
<guimenuitem>Unselect Matching Items...</guimenuitem></menuchoice> option to specify
which of the selected files should be removed from the selection.</para>

<para>Use the Menubar <menuchoice><guimenu>Edit</guimenu><guisubmenu>Selection</guisubmenu>
<guimenuitem>Unselect All</guimenuitem></menuchoice> option or just
&LMB; click on a clear area of the view to cancel the
selection.</para>

<para>You can even invert the selection: that is, deselect all selected
files and select those that were previously unselected. Use the
Menubar <menuchoice><guimenu>Edit</guimenu><guisubmenu>Selection</guisubmenu><guimenuitem>Invert
Selection</guimenuitem></menuchoice> option or <keycombo
action="simul">&Ctrl;&Shift;<keycap>A</keycap></keycombo> to do this.</para>

<guisubmenu>Create New</guisubmenu> from the <guimenu>Edit</guimenu>
menu or from the context menu you get by &RMB; clicking on a free
area in a folder view gives you a submenu letting you create any
of the following in the current folder:</para>

<listitem><para>This lets you create an icon to open &konqueror; at a
particular folder or web page. As with <guimenuitem>Link To Application...</guimenuitem>
you can make the application icon appear on your desktop by creating the link

New...</guisubmenu> sub menu by right clicking on a free area of the
desktop.</para></listitem>

</varlistentry>

<varlistentry>
<term><guimenuitem>Link to Application...</guimenuitem></term>
<listitem><para>This option is most useful if you want to create an icon that
will open a particular application. It opens a dialog box with several tabbed
pages. The first, <guilabel>General</guilabel>, is where you choose an icon and
the text that will appear with it. The second page,
<guilabel>Permissions</guilabel>, lets you select who can use or modify the
icon. In the <guilabel>Application</guilabel> page you must enter the <guilabel>Command</guilabel> that
will run the application, for example, <userinput>kwrite</userinput> to start up
the &kwrite; text editor. <userinput>kwrite /home/pam/todo.txt</userinput> would
open the file <filename>/home/pam/todo.txt</filename> in &kwrite;. Advanced
options such as the file types which the application can open are also
available from this page.</para>

<para>To make the application icon appear on your desktop, create the link in
your <filename class="directory">~/Desktop</filename> folder (this may be 
called something slightly different depending on how &kde; was installed on 
your system) or get to the <guisubmenu>Create New...</guisubmenu> sub menu by
<mousebutton>right</mousebutton> clicking on a free area of the desktop 
instead of within &konqueror;'s window.</para>

<para>If you have a lot of specialized application links and don't want to
clutter up the desktop, then why not create them in your Applications
folder. You can get there in &konqueror; by choosing <menuchoice><guimenu>Go</guimenu>
<guimenuitem>Applications</guimenuitem></menuchoice>. Then create a single icon
on your desktop to open your Applications folder, which is usually in
<filename class="directory">~/.local/share/applications</filename>.</para>
<para>To put an application link icon into the panel, first create it in the
Applications folder then drag the icon onto a clear area of the
panel.</para>

<varlistentry>
<term><guisubmenu>Device</guisubmenu></term>
<listitem><para>Use the options in this submenu to create an icon that will mount a device
and open an instance of &konqueror; showing it's contents. To unmount the
device when you have finished with it <mousebutton>right</mousebutton> click on
the icon and select <guimenuitem>Unmount</guimenuitem>. 
However, in most cases you will want to create the icon on your desktop.

<title>Changing Names and Permissions</title>

<para>The two easiest ways to change the name of a file or folder is to either 
<mousebutton>right</mousebutton> click on it and select 
<guimenuitem>Rename</guimenuitem>, or select the file or folder and then press the <keycap>F2</keycap> button.</para>

<para>To change the name or permissions of a file or folder 
<mousebutton>right</mousebutton> click on its name or icon and select the 
<guimenuitem>Properties</guimenuitem> item, or if you have 
<quote>selected</quote> the file or folder, then you can use the Menubar 
<menuchoice><guimenu>Edit</guimenu><guimenuitem>Properties</guimenuitem>
</menuchoice> (<keycombo action="simul">&Alt;<keycap>Return</keycap></keycombo>) option.</para>

<para>This will bring up the Properties dialog box with several tabbed 
pages:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><guilabel>General</guilabel>, which gives you some
information about the item and lets you change its name and, for a folder,
the associated icon.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><guilabel>Permissions</guilabel>, which shows you the item's
ownership and access permissions and lets you change the permissions.

<title>Copy and Rename</title>
<para>If you want to make a copy of an existing file with a different name -- 
perhaps as a backup -- in the same folder as the original file, do a normal 
<guimenuitem>Copy</guimenuitem> then when you <guimenuitem>Paste</guimenuitem> 
it a dialog box will pop up  complaining that the file already exists. 
Just type the new name into the dialog's text box and press the 
<guibutton>Continue</guibutton> button (or if you are feeling lazy pressing the 
<guibutton>Suggest New Name</guibutton> button will generate a new name for you).</para>

<title>Super User Mode</title>

<para>If you are running as a normal user and try to access files outside of
your own home folder you will often be prevented from doing so and get an
error message such as <errorname>Access Denied</errorname>. </para>

<para>To access these files you need to be logged in as the system
administrator, often known as the Super User or <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>. </para>

<para>Rather than logging out then in again, you can launch &konqueror; from
the
<guimenu>K</guimenu> Menu in Super User mode by selecting
<menuchoice><guisubmenu>System</guisubmenu><guimenuitem>File Manager - Super
 User Mode
</guimenuitem></menuchoice>. You will be asked for the <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>
login password but as long as you can provide that &konqueror; will be started
up with full access privileges to all files on your system.</para>

<warning><para>Take care.  As Super User (<systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>), you have complete control of
your system, and a wrong command can easily do irrevocable damage.</para>
<para>Also, connecting to the internet as <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem> is an extremely bad idea, as it
seriously increases your vulnerability to malicious hacking.</para></warning>

<para>&kde; provides many applications which can open many different
types of file. Most of the time, the defaults will work with no
problems, but &konqueror; provides a powerful system to allow you to
change the applications used to open each file type. For more details,
choose the
<menuchoice><guimenu>Settings</guimenu><guimenuitem>Configure
Konqueror...</guimenuitem></menuchoice> menu item, select
<guilabel>File Associations</guilabel> in the configuration dialog,

<title>At the Command Line</title>

<para>Although &konqueror; is a very powerful and flexible
<acronym>GUI</acronym> file manager, there are occasions when the experienced
&Linux; / &UNIX; user wants to get down to the basics and work at the text 
command line level.</para>

<para>You can, of course, open an instance of &konsole;, perhaps with
&konqueror;'s Menubar <menuchoice><guimenu>Tools</guimenu><guimenuitem>Open
Terminal</guimenuitem></menuchoice> option or with <keycap>F4</keycap>.</para>
<para>If you only want to launch a program or view a &URL;, the <menuchoice>
<guimenu>Tools</guimenu><guimenuitem>Execute Shell Command...</guimenuitem></menuchoice> 
(<keycombo action="simul">&Ctrl;<keycap>E</keycap></keycombo>) option may be 
easier.</para>

<para><menuchoice><guimenu>Tools</guimenu><guimenuitem>Execute Shell Command...
</guimenuitem></menuchoice> (<keycombo action="simul">&Ctrl;
<keycap>E</keycap></keycombo>) opens a small command line dialog window where 
you can enter a shell command such as <userinput>ps -ax | grep kdeinit
</userinput>. Note that it does not support full featured terminal control 
characters, so applications such as <userinput>top</userinput> and <userinput>
less</userinput> will not work properly, but it is available immediately 
without the delay involved in starting &konsole;.
</para>

<para>For more complex operations, &konqueror; has another nice feature: the 
Menubar <menuchoice><guimenu>Settings</guimenu><guimenuitem>Show Terminal
Emulator</guimenuitem></menuchoice> option, which opens up a terminal window as 
a new view within &konqueror;. As long as the link icon is visible at the 
bottom right corner of each view, the terminal will follow any folder changes 
you make in the normal file manager view.</para>
